Sign up for our latest insights NEW Features Expected returns & volatilities 140+ assets over 40+ countries VISIT OUR APP Featured Insights RACWI: Reinventing Cap-Weighted Indexing By Rob Arnott, Lillian Wu September 2025 Traditional cap-weighted indexes have structural flaws that impose a costly drag on investor performance. By rethinking stock selection, the RACWI US Index offers a smarter approach that avoids deficiencies and adds value. False Choices, Real Costs: Structural Flaws in the Growth\u2013Value Duality By Que Nguyen, Omid Shakernia July 2025 To overcome the costly false duality between growth and value, we propose a model that defines growth as fast growing regardless of valuation ratios, and value as cheap regardless of growth rates\u2014treating the two as distinct, not opposing, characteristics. Must Value Be Anti-Growth? By Mario Albuquerque, Noah Beck, Que Nguyen July 2025 Many value investors fall into the trap of being anti-growth, but fundamentals can be used to identify both valuation and growth characteristics. Being growth agnostic can unlock outperformance. Expand Your Mind and Your Commodity Universe By Ben Chen, Jim Masturzo July 2025 Broadening the commodity investment universe in long-only and long-short factor portfolios, subject to capacity and tradability thresholds, can improve risk-adjusted returns through higher roll yields, liquidity premia, and added diversification. How Can \u201cSmart Beta\u201d Go Horribly Right? By Noah Beck, Xi Liu, Que Nguyen June 2025 Smart beta strategies went horribly wrong over the last eight years. But now they may be poised to go horribly right. Passive Aggressive: The Increasing Risks of Passive Dominance By Chris Brightman, Campbell Harvey, Forrest Henslee June 2025 While passive indexing increases correlations, distorts prices, and heightens systemic risk, it also creates opportunity for active investors to profit from systematic rebalancing. Stimulus Does Not Stimulate By Rob Arnott, Alex Pickard May 2025 Increased government spending and debt issuance, rather than encouraging economic growth, may actually stifle it. Walking the Tightrope: Trend Following\u2019s Tricky Tradeoffs By Jim Masturzo May 2025 The positively skewed returns of trend-following strategies offer tail protection, but increased skewness comes with a lower Sharpe ratio. Managers need to understand the tradeoff and the implications for portfolio construction. Gold $5,000? By Campbell Harvey April 2025 Driven by financialization, de-dollarization, tariffs, and economic uncertainty, the price of gold is at or near all-time highs. Can it go even higher? Why Tariffs Won\u2019t Solve Our Trade Problem By Chris Brightman April 2025 The U.S. trade deficit isn\u2019t caused by unfair trade, it\u2019s rooted in low savings, high consumption, and poor investment choices. Tariffs won\u2019t fix it, but smarter fiscal policy, regulatory reform, and increased domestic production just might. Small Caps, Big Opportunities: Investing Beyond Large-Cap Stocks By Mario Albuquerque, Xi Liu, Que Nguyen April 2025 The historically wide valuation discount between small- and large-cap stocks provides a substantial opportunity, but investors remain wary. Research shows that a smarter value approach by applying quality and momentum screens can minimize risks and enhance returns. The AI Boom vs. the Dot-Com Bubble: Have We Seen This Movie Before? By Rob Arnott, Trent Commins, Xi Liu March 2025 The narrative-driven AI boom of Nvidia and the Magnificent Seven echoes that of the dot-com bubble exemplified by Cisco and the Four Horsemen.
